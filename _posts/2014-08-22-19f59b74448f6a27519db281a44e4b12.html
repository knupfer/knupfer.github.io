<p>
In the last days, I changed the publish procedure for my homepage.
The goals hereby were:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> article storage </dt><dd>Before I maintained a tree structure for every
topic and every article was in a separate file with the name
consisting of the date and the article title.  Now all articles
reside in the same file.  This is not scalable, but scalability
is normally not the goal of a personal blog.
</dd>
<dt> emacs centric </dt><dd>Before, the files were modifyed by a shell script
and some emacs scripts, which were dependent on my
.emacs file.  Now it works just with emacs
org-mode, all that is needed is a html export which
executes a elisp sourceblock in the org-file which
splits up the resulting html into individual files.
</dd>
<dt> simpler naming </dt><dd>I use Jekyll and github for my blog, therefor the
files are required to have a certain format etc.
Now this is extracted automatically via
org-time-stamp and a md5 hash of the title.  This
results in very collision robust file names which
keep the same unless the title changes, which is
very nice for permalinks etc.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
This is the first article which I'm writing with the new setup, and
it's a lot simpler and better to maintain.  I simply use org and
haven't to worry about changes in the directory structure etc or
renaming files and titles within files and finding files.  I just
write in one file and thats all.  If I don't use a time stamp, it
won't get exported.  Alternatively I can use common org-tags
like :noexport:.
