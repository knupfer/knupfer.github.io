title:  Alas! Haskell

I've barely begun to learn haskell and I already fell in love with
it.  It is pure, it is functional, it is a <b>very</b> high level
language.  I've read nearly all of <i>learn you a haskell for great
good</i> and I can whole heartedly recommend this book.
</p>

<p>
Haskell is the first language in which I don't have to unlearn math
(e. g. the equation sign signifies in a lot of language assignment etc)
but to learn math!  I already learned about monoids, functors, monads
and type theory.  It's not only fun but also usefull in day to day
math situations in the university.

My next plan is to learn a bit of agda, which is compareable to
haskell, but uses dependant types and is much younger and more extreme
in power and even less practical.  To my knowledge there doesn't exist
any significant software written in agda.  This may sound like good to
avoid such a language, but I think different.  For me, learning a
language is pure intellectual diversion, probably I'll not earn mony
with programming anything (my profession is physics and music).  So
for me it's more valuable if somthing is interesting.

Beeing a fan of unicode I noticed one annoyance with haskell:  it is
perfectly possible and fine to use unicode symbols in haskell code
when you enable some extensions.  But hlint, which is the work of a
genius, doesn't play well with it, if I use âˆˆ instead of `elem` it
does no longer suggest improvements, thats so sad!  Perhaps this is
going to be my first haskell related patch&#x2026;
