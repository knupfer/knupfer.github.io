Hey, it's emacs time!
</p>

<p>
I got these days totaly baffeld by the glory of emacs.  I coded nearly
all the examples at coding bat and thought, that I should optimize a
bit my emacs before I start to learn python.

After digging into emacswiki, I read various posts about turning emacs
into an IDE.  Actually, I don't see why the combination of some modes
should be called an IDE.  Emacs integrates so much that already the
nethack-mode makes it an IDE&#x2026;
</p>

Well, I learned about flycheck-mode and was very surprised how
advanced it is.  I use it with (non-emacs) pylint and it works
wonders, even on very slow pc (I use a 1Ghz arm-tablet, which is way
slower than a laptop with 5 years).  Additionally I use jedi to get
code completion and ya-snippet to automatically insert a doctest with
three cases into every function.  When needing more cases, I'll pick
unittests.

I've got code completion, tooltips with documentation, a very rigid
linter which checks errors, not used variables and moduls, conventions
etc. on the fly and I've got a templating system.  I think thats quite
good to start learning python.  And the best is, that it consumes only
very little resources (important for my hardware, for example exclips
takes 4 minutes to start and crashes after some minutes my tablet by
overheating it (most interesting that this is possible)).
