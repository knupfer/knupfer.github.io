In the last few days, I came accros the pretty nice wikipedia article
about <i>outliner</i>.  Inspired from some presented solutions I came up with
the idea, to implement parts of them in my favorite editor emacs.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-12-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-12-1"> org-mode</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-1">
<p>
As the title suggests I use org-mode for all my wrintings and
organisation so it was quite obvious to write my extension for
org-mode which in it self is already a very good outliner.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-12-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-12-2"> Features</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-2">
<p>
The main idea was to implement multiple panes, one pane which always
displays only top headings, one pane which displays all headings and
one pane displaying the actual content.
</p>

<p>
But the idea evolved a bit, by tracking the movement made in any of
theese panes and reflecting it in the other panes making navigating
very effective and uniform.
</p>

<p>
For example it is possible to jump in the overview called top headings
pane from top heading to top heading and afterwards jump with the
contents pane to the subheading.
</p>

<p>
Automatically the contents pane tries to center and show the entire
heading tree, if that is not possible for space reasons, it centers
the position of the cursor with a slight offset depending on the
relative position in the tree to ensure that at the beginning it is
shown a bit of context in the antecedent tree and at the end a bit of
the following tree.  Additionally, this indicates in an unobstrusive
way the remaining size of the tree.

<div id="outline-container-sec-12-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-12-3"> Performance</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-3">
<p>
At first, the extension was so resource consuming that it wasn't
possible to actively maintain position etc. with each command (a so
called post-command-hook in emacs terms), so I implemented it in a
way, that would calculate the new position of the panes and their
highlighting only when the user was for some time idle (0.1s).  On my
slow tablet this was not enough, so I used a catch throw construct to
be able to abort imediately a calculation when the user interacts with
the editor.  The advantage is, that it does never get in the way with
typing, the disadvantage is, that while navigating or typing fast, the
other panes would get async.
</p>

<p>
The next steps were to heavy optimize ressource consumption.  Here I
used various means:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>make a string of all visible headings in the show all pane and
consider updates in the other panes only when this string changes.
This is especially useful, because it ignores cursor movements
without scrolling
</li>
<li>remember in which major heading tree the cursor is to prevent
updating the overview pane when this doesn't change
</li>
<li>profiling the functions with following enhancements:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>in elisp regexp searches are much faster than line-movements, so
prefer more complicated regexps to reduce foreward-line commands
</li>
<li>avoid when possible recentering the panes, this is especially
costly: compute the amount of change and recenter only when a
certain threshold passes.
</li>
<li>when in the same heading tree, do certain updates, like overlays
for hidden trees, only when there was an editing command, not when
there is only a movement command.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These steps achieved a more than 100-times reduction of cpu
consumption which enables to instantly update the panes (when
necessary) after each command of the user even on my slow tablet.
