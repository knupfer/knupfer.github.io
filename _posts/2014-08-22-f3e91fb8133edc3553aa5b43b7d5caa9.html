I've written a pretty nice mode for lilypond, which tries to make
lilypond coding less error prone.  It uses functions of LilyPond-mode
(yes, it uses CamelCase) to display the notes in a distance which
correlates with their duration.  Therefor, the bar sign | will be all
in one row if all is correct (the music and the parser), if the bar is
overfull or underfull it shows +- signs alla git.
</p>

<p>
That is already quite nice, but it gets even more interesting.  If you
put after a barline the barnumber, e. g. %7, it will enumerate all
consecutive lines which end in barlines.  If you put another barnumber
in one of the following lines, it adjusts accordingly.  If there is a
gap, for example by ending a voice and beginning another, it will stop
enumerating unless it finds new numbers.  The result is a much more
comfortable bug squashing after looking at the pdf.
</p>

<p>
The last feature is a interpreter for music.  The minor mode will
parse the entire file and count which beats are frequently used and
marks this beats with lines colord according to the frequency.  This
provides a robust way to determine the correct length of a bar for
good layouting (for example 72 columns) and to aide writing music.
You see imediatly if the notes are on heavy beats or light beats.  You
don't even have to hear or see the music and it provides a quite
useful impression of the measure of the piece.  If you've got piece in
5/4, you'll see whether it is a (2+3)/4 or a (3+2)/4.  You see even
different dances like sarabande.
</p>

<p>
There are some shortcomings of this mode.  Sometimes the get-beat
function from LilyPond-mode fails to count the beat at point.  This
happens for more complex music, with voice splits in one voice, and in
the first bar of every voice (it's quite possible that this bug will
be fixed).  Another major flaw is that it can't handle changes in
meter or changes in the emphasize pattern (for example hemiola).
Performance was a big problem which is now resolved, by parsing the
file line by line only when idle, aborting on user input and resuming
after the input at the last position.  Will writing the music it keeps
analysing it and tracking changes of the priority of beats with
accordingly changing colors.  Depending on speed of the computer and
size of the piece, this might take some seconds (which never block the
user).

At the left side you see "An den Mond" from Schumann and on the right
side you see the Ricercare a 6 from Bach.  You see how the minor-mode
realised that the first is in 3/4 and the third quarter is more
important than the second.  The Ricercare is more complictated and
uses a 4/2 meter but is as well good identified and uses about the
same space and shows a preference of the piece for the middle of the
meter.
