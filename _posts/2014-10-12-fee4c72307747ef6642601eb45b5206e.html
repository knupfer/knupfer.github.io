Today I had a very interesting discussion about methological clearness
in empirical research.  The assumption of a researcher was, that the
goal of a thesis which focuses the creation of a new theory by using
qualitativ techniques is only the theory and not the reproducibility
of the method with the given population used in this thesis.
</p>

<p>
He said, that the point is the theory and that it can be proven with
any population and therefor puplcation of the entire raw data is not
important.  I would like to argue, that this is inresponsible to the
scientific community, because empiric studies are extremely expensive
to reproduce, so it is an obligation to make this reproduction more
feasible by providing the own data to avoid another sampling of data.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, he understood my point, but said, that this are two
different aspects and this can't be the indicator of a good thesis.  I
disagree.  What is the quality of a thesis, or how is it defined?  I
would argue, that the quality is the contribution to the wisdom of the
society and the contribution of the scientific community.  If this is
true, the avoidance of work for the community is an improvement in the
critical reproducibility which allows the community to easily verify
or falsify the result of the thesis and afterwards build on it or
reject it.
</p>

<p>
So should we be theoretic and pursue soley the quality of a theorie,
or should we be more pragmatic and aid the community?  I'm clearly for
the second solution.
