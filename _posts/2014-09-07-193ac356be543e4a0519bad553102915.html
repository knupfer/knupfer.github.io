In the last days I've been reading a lot about python and haskell.
They are both very different on many aspects, but both very
interesting for me.

Python was born as a language for teaching, it is dynamically typed
and is very readable.  The readability comes from the missing type
declarations and the omission of block delimiters, or more precise:
the omissing of block closing delimiters.  The open delimiters are
semicolon.

Haskell was born as a research language.  It's purely
functional, i. e. nearly every functions result is determined only by
the input.  The fascinating consequence is, that functions can be
called in parallel as long they do not depend on the other funcitons
output and results of function calls can be saved to omit the
calculation if the function is later called with the same arguments.
</p>

<p>
The determinism provides, that the correctness of a program can be
proven, because every function can be fed with all possible inputs, or
at least can be shown, that with all possible input the output is
sane.
</p>

<p>
These properties allow for very sophisticated tests (quicktests) which
do not feed the function with predefined input (like classic unit
tests) but try to falsify the function (with infinite garbage, limited
only by time and cpu power).

I think I'll learn both languages.  The pureness of haskell is
enormously fascinating and the ease of coding in python is a
pleasure.  So propabably I'll mix the two and write emacs extensions
in these languages (elisp is great, but I want to learn sth new and
emacs extensions are a great motivation).
